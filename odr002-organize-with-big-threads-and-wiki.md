# 002: Organise With Big Threads & Wiki

Status: Accepted

## Context

To organise Heart of Clojure we need to work on a variety of aspects: booking a venue, facilitating the CFP, marketing the conference, catering, etc.

Because the conference is not-for-profit we hope to attract a handful of volunteers that share our vision about a community-focused conference in the Clojure space. To enable everyone to coordinate we will eventually need some tools where we can keep track of what needs to be done, store important notes and so on.

## Decision

We will use the Clojureverse.org Discourse instance to track different "sub projects" of the conference and communicate within the conference team. 

Specifically we will create topics for each of the major aspects of the conference:

- Call for Speakers
- Budgeting
- Catering
- Venue
- Marketing
- Tickets / Pricing

And more as needed. These topics will be turned into *wikis* upon creation allowing editing of the topmost post by everyone involved.

The first post should always contain a list of tasks. Ideally this list is very detailed and allows volunteers to look at it and know what to do more or less immediately. 

Everyone is invited to split up larger tasks into more concrete, easy-to-tackle units. 

Because each topic is also a communication channel it can be used to post updates or discuss details of the task at hand.

This approach does lack a lot of advanced features that tools like Trello et al. provide but we feel it is a good compromise between the communication and task-tracking needs we have.

## Consequences

We need to get all organisers and volunteers on Clojureverse.org.

Because Discourse is not a task manager we might need to manually review and the task list and progress.
