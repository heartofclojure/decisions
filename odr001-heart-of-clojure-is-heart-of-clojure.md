# Context

We felt a need for a European summer conference, to bring certain ideas and
values to the European Clojure conference scene.

# Decision

The conference will be named "Heart of Clojure".

# Motivation

This name signifies that it is a conference "with a heart", caring about
community, diversity, and providing not just knowledge, but an immersive
experience.

It is a conference that gets to "the heart of Clojure", exploring the
significance and impact of this technology and its ecosystem.

Finally it is a conference in the "Heart of Europe", highly accessible from tech
hubs around the continent, providing an opportunity for the European community
to meet, to forge new ties or to renew existing ones.

# Status

*ACCEPTED*

# Consequences

This name is the starting point for building this conference's identity. It
communicates our vision for a particular type of event, one that with deliberate
effort we can make a reality.
