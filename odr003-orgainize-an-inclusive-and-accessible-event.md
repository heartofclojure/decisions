# 003: Organize an inclusive and accessible event

## Status

ACCEPTED

## Context

Too often the people that participate in tech events come from a very narrow and
homogenous demographic. Subtle biases present in these groups persist and lead
to exclusion.

## Decision

Heart of Clojure will be an *inclusive* and *accessible* event.

Inclusive means we create an environment in which all people feel valued and respected.

Accessible means that people are able to participate in the event, including people with disabilities.

## Consequences

Aiming to be inclusive and accessible touches every aspect of organizing, and
needs to be kept in mind at all times. Some practical consequences include

- adopting a Code of Conduct and enforcing it
- choosing a venue that is wheelchair accessible
- keeping ticket prices low
- providing scholarship tickets for underrepresented groups
- providing food in accordance with people's dietary requirement
- providing captioning (stenographer)
